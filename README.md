## Homework assignment 3
To implement a binary search tree in C or Python, you need a Node.  A Node has a data field and two links, the left child (lc) and rc.  
lc or rc point to a Node. If lc or rc point to nothing, we denote it as a Nil. In the class, I draw square nodes for Nils, and circular nodes for internal nodes.  
Show that the number of square nodes is n+1 if there are n circular nodes.
